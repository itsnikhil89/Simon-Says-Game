"Simon Says" is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors in the correct order. The game gets progressively harder as the sequence gets longer.HTML creates the game structure with buttons representing different colors and display elements for score and level. CSS styles the game to ensure a visually appealing and responsive interface. JavaScript drives the game logic, including generating random sequences, capturing user input, and providing feedback for correct or incorrect sequences. The game starts with a "Start" button, and as the player progresses, the sequences become longer, challenging their memory and pattern recognition skills.
